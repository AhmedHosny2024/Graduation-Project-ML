import pandas as pd
# 1 read images
# read train.csv and test.csv
# train = pd.read_csv('train.csv')
# test = pd.read_csv('test.csv')


# 2 add noise and save the label as the key
# 3 train the model
# 4 test the model
# 5 save the model
# 6 after the training finish and the model is saved, we can use the model to detect the noise type and apply the correct function to remove the noise
# 7 calculate the SSIM and PSNR for each denoised image
